#Ikea Idasen Desk
This repository is about controlling [Ikea's Idasen Desk](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/idasen-desk-sit-stand-black-dark-grey-s29280991/) using Windows 10/11 and BluetoothLE. Ikea only provides an Android and IOs app to control the desk. I thought it would be far more convenient to control the desk using a Windows 10/11. The [installation instructions](#Installation) can be found at the end of this document.

# Problems
_Q: The application fails to connect to the Idasen desk?_

A: Windows 10 needs to be connected to the Idasen desk which means the desk should be listed as a Bluetooth device.
