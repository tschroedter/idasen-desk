# Changelog Automation Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds automated changelog generation to the idasen-desk repository using GitHub Actions. The solution automatically tracks changes through Pull Requests and generates comprehensive release notes.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Files Created

#### CHANGELOG.md
- Located in repository root
- Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- Initialized with recent changes from README
- Automatically updated when releases are published

#### .github/release-drafter.yml
- Configuration file for the Release Drafter action
- Defines PR label categories:
  - üöÄ Features (feature, enhancement)
  - üêõ Bug Fixes (fix, bugfix, bug)
  - üß∞ Maintenance (chore, maintenance)
  - üìö Documentation (documentation, docs)
  - üîí Security (security)
- Version bump labels (major, minor, patch)
- Template for release notes

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### .github/workflows/release-drafter.yml
- Runs on: push to main, PR events, manual trigger
- Automatically creates and updates draft releases
- Generates release notes from merged PRs
- Categorizes changes based on PR labels

#### .github/workflows/update-changelog.yml
- Runs on: release published, manual trigger
- Updates CHANGELOG.md with published release notes
- Commits changes back to main branch
- Uses [skip ci] to prevent workflow loops

### 3. Documentation

#### docs/CHANGELOG_AUTOMATION.md
- Comprehensive guide for using the changelog automation
- Explains the workflow process
- Documents PR labeling strategy
- Provides best practices
- Includes configuration details

#### README.md Updates
- Added Release Drafter workflow badge
- Added note about automated changelog tracking
- Links to CHANGELOG.md and automation guide

### 4. Helper Tools

#### scripts/create-labels.sh
- Bash script to create all required PR labels
- Uses GitHub CLI (gh) for automation
- Creates labels with appropriate colors and descriptions
- Can be run by repository maintainers

#### .github/pull_request_template.md
- Template for all new Pull Requests
- Includes changelog label checklist
- Reminds contributors to add appropriate labels
- Links to automation documentation

## How It Works

### For Contributors

1. Create a Pull Request with changes
2. Add appropriate label(s) from the PR template checklist
3. Merge the PR to main
4. Changes automatically appear in the draft release

### For Maintainers

1. Review the draft release generated by Release Drafter
2. Edit/enhance the release notes if needed
3. Publish the release when ready
4. CHANGELOG.md automatically updates with the release notes

### Automatic Processes

1. **On PR Merge to Main:**
   - Release Drafter workflow runs
   - Updates draft release with PR details
   - Categorizes changes based on labels

2. **On Release Publish:**
   - Update Changelog workflow runs
   - Adds release notes to CHANGELOG.md
   - Commits the updated file back to main

## Setup Required (One-Time)

### 1. Create PR Labels

Option A - Using the script:
```bash
gh auth login
./scripts/create-labels.sh
```

Option B - Manual creation:
Visit https://github.com/tschroedter/idasen-desk/labels and create labels as documented in docs/CHANGELOG_AUTOMATION.md

### 2. Enable Workflows

The workflows are automatically enabled when merged to main. They will start working immediately on the next PR or push.

### 3. Test the Setup

1. Create a test PR with a label
2. Merge it to main
3. Check that a draft release is created/updated
4. Publish the release (optional)
5. Verify CHANGELOG.md is updated (if release was published)

## Benefits

1. **Automated Release Notes:** No more manual changelog updates
2. **Consistent Format:** All releases follow the same structure
3. **Better Tracking:** Easy to see what changed in each release
4. **Contributor Friendly:** Clear guidance on how to categorize changes
5. **Time Saving:** Reduces manual work for maintainers
6. **History Preservation:** Complete changelog history in CHANGELOG.md

## Compatibility

- Works with existing dotnet-ci.yml workflow
- Does not interfere with current release process
- Draft releases can be edited before publishing
- Compatible with semantic versioning

## Files Modified

1. **Created:**
   - CHANGELOG.md
   - .github/release-drafter.yml
   - .github/workflows/release-drafter.yml
   - .github/workflows/update-changelog.yml
   - .github/pull_request_template.md
   - docs/CHANGELOG_AUTOMATION.md
   - scripts/create-labels.sh

2. **Modified:**
   - README.md (added badge and links)

## Next Steps

1. **Merge this PR** to main
2. **Run the label creation script** or create labels manually
3. **Create a test PR** to verify the workflow
4. **Publish a release** to test the changelog update
5. **Start using labels** on all future PRs

## Support

For questions or issues with the changelog automation:
- See docs/CHANGELOG_AUTOMATION.md for detailed usage
- Check workflow runs in Actions tab
- Review release-drafter.yml configuration
- Verify PR labels are correctly applied

## Maintenance

The workflows use well-maintained GitHub Actions:
- release-drafter/release-drafter@v6
- stefanzweifel/changelog-updater-action@v1
- stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v5

These should be periodically updated to their latest versions.
